large Random tree and random forest don't work

Change type:
REPT default a 84.9403% f 0.844
j48 default a 83.9296% f 0.834
both are higher than if crafting materials alone is done 75/25 (overall data is about 75% no change)

1 day results: we have a roughly 2:4:1 ratio of items that go down/up/same for instances we predict will go up, and we capture about 53% of the "up" instances properly, incorrectly marking the others about 50/50 as down/same

extrapolate: REPT tree seem to often feed into a loop - would mostly input the exact same predictions for everything

random trees seem to overfit, but testing to see if that matters for extrapolation
