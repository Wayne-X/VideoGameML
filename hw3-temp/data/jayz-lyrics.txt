Let us die young or let us live forever We don’t have the power but we never say never Sitting in a sandpit Life is a short trip The music’s for the sad man Forever young I wanna be forever young Do you really want to live forever? Forever and ever Forever young I wanna be Forever young Do you really want to live forever? Forever forever So we live a life like a video When the sun is always out and you never get old And the champagne’s always cold And the music is always good And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of dat pretty ass car Without a wrinkle in today Cuz there is no tomorrow Just some picture perfect day To last a whole lifetime And it never ends Cos all we have to do is hit rewind So lets just stay in the moment smoke some weed Drink some wine Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind Leave a mark that can’t erase neither space nor time So when the director yells cut I’ll be fine I’m forever young Fear not when fear not why Fear not much while were alive Life is for living not living up tight See ya somewhere up in the sky Fear not die I'll be alive for a million years bye bye So not for legends I'm forever young My name shall survive Through the darkest blocks over kitchen stoves Over Pyrex pots my name shall be passed down to generations While debating up in barber shops young slung hung here Shorty the nigga from here With a little ambition just what we can become here And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears Younger kid younger every year yeah So if you love me baby this is how you let me know Don’t ever let me go thats how you let me know baby Slamming Bentley doors Hopping out of Porsche’s Popping up on Forbes lists Gorgeous Hold up Niggas thought I lost it They be talking bullshit I be talking more shit They nauseous Hold up I'll be here forever You know I'm on my fall shit And I ain’t waiting for closure I will never forfeit Less than four bars Guru bring the chorus in Did you get the picture yet I’m painting you a portrait of young
